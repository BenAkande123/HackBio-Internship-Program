# About
This internship program is aimed at making coding accessible to all life scientists.
Life scientists aiming to add Bioinformatics to their research due to its flexibility will find this program highly beneficial and informative.

The internship is a 4-week practical-oriented virtual activity aimed at equipping life scientists with computational biology insights while tackling everyday biological problems.
The advantage of computational biology/bioinformatics to wet-lab technique is that it provides researchers another lens to view biological processes that might not be possible by traditional means.

# Programming Language 
The internship is taught in both R and Python. But all scripts in this repository are written in R.
