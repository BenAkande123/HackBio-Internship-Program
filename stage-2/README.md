# Task 2.6: Transcriptomics

The dataset can be found [here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/stephenturner/806e31fce55a8b7175af/raw/1a507c4c3f9f1baaa3a69187223ff3d3050628d4/results.txt)

The goal of this task is to visualize differential gene expression data via volcano plot, categorize the various gene expressions, and determine the function of the top 5 genes using genecards. To provide some perspective, the dataset contains an experiment between a diseased cell line and diseased cell lines treated with compound X. The difference in expression change between the two health statuses is computed as log2FoldChange and p-value.

The solutions to the task can be found here and all the codes are written in R.
